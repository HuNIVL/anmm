The Wildman is often depicted with a tree trunk or large club in his hand, emphasising his powerful strength. He was a well-known myth across Europe, taking various forms and often used as an explanation for unusual events - such as strange weather patterns or missing people. The Wildman was feared due to his strength and mystery but you could be protected against him if you carried a likeness of him with you. Thus he began to appear on coins from around 1530 beginning with those of Henry the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

The BATAVIA was carrying 137 carved sandstone blocks and 6 bronze pintles (gate hinges) which were destined to form the watergate of Fort Batavia. The reconstructed portico is now at the Western Australian Maritime Museum. These 3 pieces were amongst a number of blocks left over from the reconstruction. It is unknown what the largest block would have been used for but the 2 smaller pieces may have formed part of a gunport or window. The small honeycomb-like pattern on the surface of the blocks is a peculiarity of Renaissance style typical of central Germany between about 1530 and 1630. Recent scientific analysis shows that the sandstone comes from the Bentheim quarry in Germany (Bentheim sandstone was also being used for architectural sculpture in Amsterdam at the time).,1629-12-31,Pintle,,,,,,Pintle,,https://collections.sea.museum/objects/160555,1629-01-01,,Bronze pintle for portico door from the wreck site of the BATAVIA,Tools and equipment,https://collections.sea.museum/collections
